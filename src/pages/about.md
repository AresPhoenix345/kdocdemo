# About this Prototype

This website is a **prototype/demo** for the LFX Mentorship 2026 Term 1 project: **KubeStellar Documentation and Self-Service Enablement**.

## What this demo is

- A presentable, navigable documentation site showcasing the **intended deliverables**
- A clear narrative for the **vision, timeline, and success metrics**
- A structure that mirrors how real users approach onboarding and problem-solving

## What this demo is not

- Not a full replacement for the official documentation site
- Not a production deployment guide for all environments
- Not a complete reference for every KubeStellar API surface

## Where the content comes from

This repo includes:
- `kubestellar/`: the main KubeStellar project repo (source of truth for concepts and scripts)
- `ks-docs/`: the documentation/UI repo (additional explanatory content and structure)

This prototype re-packages those concepts into a “self-service-first” layout aimed at reducing **time-to-first-success**.

## How to use this site

- Start with **[Quickstart](/docs/quickstart)** if you want to deploy quickly
- Use **[Architecture](/docs/architecture/overview)** when you need conceptual clarity
- Use **[Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting)** when you’re blocked
